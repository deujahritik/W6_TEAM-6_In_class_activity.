## OBJECT DETECTION FOR SMART PLANT CARE
*Raspberry Pi-based RC car with object detection for smart plant care is to navigate a greenhouse or a large outdoor garden to monitor plant growth and health.*

*The RC car could be equipped with a camera and a LiDAR sensor to capture images and measure the distance to plants. The camera can be used for object identification, while the LiDAR sensor can provide more precise distance measurements, which can help identify the height and growth of the plants.*

*The RC car can be programmed to navigate through the garden autonomously and take images of the plants. The images can then be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify any abnormalities in the plant growth, such as wilting or discoloration. The RC car can also be programmed to water plants automatically using a water pump and a moisture sensor. The moisture sensor can detect when the soil is dry, and the RC car can move to the plant and water it using the water pump.*

*This scenario demonstrates how the RC car can be used to automate plant care and reduce manual labor. By combining object detection, distance measurement, and autonomous navigation, the RC car can efficiently monitor plant growth and health, and take action when necessary. With further development and integration with other sensors and modules, such as temperature and humidity sensors, the RC car can provide even more advanced capabilities for smart plant care.*

## Steps to implement above scenario.
* 1.Setup Raspberry Pi and RC car hardware components such as the camera, LiDAR sensor, water pump, and moisture sensor.*

*2.Installing necessary software libraries and packages for object detection, distance measurement, and autonomous navigation.*

*3.Writing code in python  to capture images and measure distances using the camera and LiDAR sensor.*

*4.Using machine learning algorithms such as CNNs or object detection libraries such as OpenCV to analyze the images and detect abnormalities in plant growth.*

*5.Write code to navigate the RC car autonomously using distance measurements from the LiDAR sensor and avoid obstacles.*

*6.Implementing code to water plants automatically using the water pump and moisture sensor.*

*7.Continuously monitor plant growth and health using the RC car and  adjustments can be needed to the code as needed to improve performance.*
